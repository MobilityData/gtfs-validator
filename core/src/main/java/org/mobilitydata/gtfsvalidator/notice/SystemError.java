/**
 * SystemError is the base class for all notices related to retrieving and processing a GTFS feed.
 * The system errors are not related to the content of the feed itself.
 *
 * <p>System errors include internal errors in the validator (e.g., runtime exceptions) and failure
 * to download or to store a feed.
 *
 * <p>Users should not normally inherit from this class. All validators written by users should
 * generate subclasses of {@link ValidationNotice}.
 *
 * <p>A validation-as-a-service solution should not share system errors with external clients
 * because that may leak internal information. Only validation notices should be shared.
