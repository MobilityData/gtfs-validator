/**
 * The value in CSV file has leading or trailing whitespaces.
 *
 * <p>This notice is emitted for values protected with double quotes since whitespaces for
 * non-protected values are trimmed automatically by CSV parser.
 *
 * <p>This is a warning in the upstream validator.
 *
 * <p>GTFS Validator strips whitespaces from protected values. We do not see any use case when such
 * a whitespace may be needed. On the other hand, some real-world feeds use trailing whitespaces for
 * some values and omit them for the others. This is causing the largest problem when a primary key
 * and a foreign key differ just by a whitespace: it is clear that they are intended to be the same,
 * that is why we always strip whitespaces.
