# output-validator

A tool to compare validation reports produced by the [gtfs-validator](https://www.github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator).

# Introduction
This is a command-line tool written in Java that performs the following steps:
1. loads validation reports from disk;
1. compares pairs of validation reports produced by two versions of the validator;  
1. generates a report that quantifies the new errors introduced by a new implementation. 

# Run the app via command line
### Setup
1. Install Java 17 or higher. To check which version of Java is installed on your computer, type the following command in the terminal: `java --version`. You can download Java from one of the following sources:
    - **[Eclipse Adoptium (Temurin)](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/)** – Open-source & widely used
    - **[Amazon Corretto](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/)** - AWS-supported, optimized for cloud
    - **[Azul Zulu](https://www.azul.com/downloads/)** - Enterprise ready
    - **[Microsoft Build of OpenJDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/openjdk/download/)** - Microsoft's JDK
    - **[Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)** - Official Java from Oracle
2. Download [output-comparator-v3.0.0_cli.jar](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator/releases/download/v3.0.0/output-comparator-v3.0.0_cli.jar)

### Run it
To validate a GTFS dataset on your computer:

`java -jar output-validator-v3.0.0.jar --report_directory /path/to/validation/reports --new_error_threshold 1 --percent_invalid_datasets_threshold 40 --reference_report_name report.json --latest_report_name latest.json --output_base path/to/output/directory --source_urls /path/to/source/urls` 

where:
* *(Required)* `--report_directory` or `-d`: path to the validation reports     
* *(Required)* `--new_error_threshold` or `-n`: the number of new errors after which a dataset is considered invalid   
* *(Required)* `--percent_invalid_datasets_threshold` or `-p`: threshold for the percentage of newly invalid datasets out of total datasets in the mobility archives. If the observed percentage is greater than or equal to this threshold, the acceptance test will fail.
* *(Required)* `--source_urls` or `-s`: path to the file that contains a list of urls to the datasets that are analyzed in the acceptance tests
* *(Required)* `--output_base` or `-o`:  the path where the validation report will be stored (e.g., `output`)   
* *(Optional)* `--reference_report_name` or `-r`: the name of the validation report generated by the source of truth   
* *(Optional)* `--latest_report_name` or `-l`: the name of the validation report generated by the proposed version of the gtfs-validator   

More information for how this tool is used with GitHub Actions to test validator code changes on real-world datasets is in our [acceptance test documentation](../docs/ACCEPTANCE_TESTS.md).
