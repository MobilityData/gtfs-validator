      # The following steps will publish artifacts to a sonatype staging repo with the aim of promoting them to maven central
      # Pretty much everything is done through gradle.
      # The version used will be according to the axion-release-plugin, meaning it will take a tag if present.
      # The tag should follow semantic versioning, e.g. v1.2.3. There could be a suffix, e.g. v1.2.3-TEST
      # gradle will build, sign then upload artifacts to a Sonatype staging repo.
      # See https://s01.oss.sonatype.org for accessing these repos.
      # At this point it should manually be closed, which will trigger acceptance tests for maven central (but not transfer yet)
      # Once closed, the repo is available for testing.
      # After testing, it can be manually promoted on the sonatype site, which will then publish to maven central.
      # Note than once in maven central a release cannot be removed or altered.
