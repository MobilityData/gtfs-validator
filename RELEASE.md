### 2. Do the release
1. While CI is running to create the artifacts, you can work on the release description. ![edit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35747326/99821184-ba080380-2b1f-11eb-8efe-57be80a0bd29.png)


üí° Command to find PRs merged after a certain date:
```
is:pr is:closed merged:>2020-07-28 base:master sort:updated-desc 
```
2. When the CI is done, drag and drop the artifacts in the pre release assets section. You'll need to manually rename some of the assets for now (see below).

‚ÄºÔ∏è **TODO**: The CI `.yml` files should be updated so that the output artifact names don't contain spaces and don't have to be manualy reworked when attached to a release (all space characters are replaced by . characters by GitHub).

3. Once everything is ready, simply uncheck the `pre release` box and publish again ‚úÖ
