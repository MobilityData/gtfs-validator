# gtfs-validator [![Java CI](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator/workflows/Java%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Java+CI%22) [![Join the gtfs-validator chat](https://mobilitydata-io.herokuapp.com/badge.svg)](https://mobilitydata-io.herokuapp.com/)

A static [General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)](http://gtfs.org/reference/static/) feed validator

# Introduction

This command-line tool written in Java that performs the following steps:
1. Loads input GTFS zip file from a URL or disk
1. Checks files integrity, numeric type parsing and ranges as well as string format according to the [GTFS specification](http://gtfs.org/reference/static/#field-types) using [this schema file](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator/blob/v1.1.0/adapter/repository/in-memory-simple/src/main/resources/gtfs_spec.asciipb)
1. Performs basic GTFS business rule validation *(work-in-progress)*

# Prerequisites
1. Install [Java 11 or higher](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
1. Download the latest gtfs-validator JAR (cli or web) file from our [Releases page](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator/releases) or snapshot artifact from a [workflow execution](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator/actions?query=branch%3Amaster)

# Usage

## cli-app usage

### Validate a locally stored GTFS dataset

Sample usage:

``` 
java -jar gtfs-validator-v1.3.0_cli.jar -i relative/path/to/zipped_dataset -o relative/output/path -e relative/extraction/path -x enumeration_of_files_to_exclude_from_validation_process
```

...which will:
 1. Search for a zipped GTFS dataset located at `relative/path/to/zipped_dataset`
 1. Extract the zip content to a directory located at `relative/extraction/path`
 1. Validate the GTFS data and output the results to the directory located at `relative/output/path`. Validation results are exported to JSON by default. The validation process will not be executed on the enumeration of files provided via option `-x` and the files that rely on them.

#### Example: Validate GTFS dataset while specifying extraction, input, and output directories

``` 
java -jar gtfs-validator-v1.3.0_cli.jar -i gtfs-dataset.zip -o output_folder -e extraction_folder
```

In order, this command line will:
 1. Search for a zipped GTFS dataset name `gtfs-dataset.zip` located in the working directory
 1. Extract its content to a directory named `extraction_folder`
 1. Validate the GTFS data and output the results to the directory named `output_folder`. This folder will contain a single `.json` file with information related to the validation process.
 1. The generated `.json` file will be beautified if option `-b` or `--beautify`  has been provided and set to `true`. Note that if this argument is not specified, the validator will by default generate a beautified version of the validation report. 
 


#### Example: Validate a subset of a GTFS dataset.

``` 
java -jar gtfs-validator-v1.3.0_cli.jar -i gtfs-dataset.zip  -x fare_attributes.txt,attributions.txt
```

In order, this command line will:
 1. Search for a zipped GTFS dataset name `gtfs-dataset.zip` located in the working directory
 1. Create a directory named `input` 
 1. Extract the content of `gtfs-dataset.zip` to the directory created at step 2
 1. Create a directory names `output`
 1. Exclude files `fare_attributes.txt` and `attributions.txt` from the validation process. But also the files that rely on them: `translations.txt` and `fare_rules.txt`
 1. Validate the GTFS data and output the results to the directory created at step 4. This folder will contain a single `.json` file with information related to the validation process.

### Validate a GTFS dataset stored on a remote server

Sample usage:

``` 
java -jar gtfs-validator-v1.3.0_cli.jar -u url/to/dataset -o relative/output/path -e relative/extraction/path -i input.zip
```

...which will:
 1. Download the GTFS feed at the URL `url/to/dataset` and name it `input.zip`  
 1. Extract the `input.zip` content to the directory located at `relative/extraction/path`
 1. Validate the GTFS data and output the results to the directory located at `relative/output/path`. Validation results are exported to JSON by default.

#### Example: Validate a GTFS dataset and export the validation result as proto files

``` 
java -jar gtfs-validator-v1.3.0_cli.jar -u url/to/dataset -o output_folder -e extraction_folder -i local-dataset.zip -p
```

In order, this command line will:
 1. Download the GTFS feed at the URL `url/to/dataset` and name it `local-dataset.zip`
 1. Extract the `local-dataset.zip` content to the directory `extraction_folder`
 1. Validate the GTFS data and output the results to the directory `output_folder`. As option `-p` is provided, results will be exported as `.pb` files

#### Example: Validate a GTFS dataset without specifying command arguments or providing configuration file

``` 
java -jar gtfs-validator-v1.3.0_cli.jar
```

In order, this command line will:
 1. Search for a zipped folder in the working directory
 1. Extract by default the content of the zipped GTFS dataset to directory `gtfs-validator/input/`  
 1. Validate the GTFS data and output the results to directory `gtfs-validator/output`. Validation results will be exported to JSON by default.


For a list of all available commands, use `--help`:

``` 
java -jar gtfs-validator-v1.3.0_cli.jar --help
```

### Software configuration

Execution parameters are configurable through command-line or via a configuration file `execution-parameters.json`. 
By default, if no command-line is provided the validation process will look for execution parameters in user configurable configuration file `execution-parameters.json`.
In the case said file could not be found or is incomplete, default values will be used.

One should note that if both command-line options and configuration file are provided, the configuration file takes precedence over the command option.

Sample usage:

The two following sample usages are equivalent, provided that `execution-parameters.json` file is located in the working directory:

``` 
java -jar gtfs-validator-v1.3.0_cli.jar -e relative/extraction/path -o relative/output/path -i relative/path/to/zipped_dataset -x agency.txt,routes.txt
```
```
{
  "extract": "relative/extraction/path",
  "output": "relative/output/path",
  "input": "relative/path/to/zipped_dataset",
  "exclude": "agency.txt,routes.txt"
}
```

Note that you'll need to change the above JAR file name to whatever [release version](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator/releases) you download.

## spring-boot-app usage

A second implementation of `gtfs-validator` uses [`SpringBoot`](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) framework and a user interface (based on [`React`](https://reactjs.org/)).

### Run the application

```
java -jar gtfs-validator-v1.3.0_web.jar 
```

Which will:
1. Launch server side of application on port `8090`
1. Launch client side of the application on port `8090`

Open your favorite browser and go to `http://localhost:8090` the user interface of the application should be displayed as follows:
![User Interface](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35747326/94601198-1efe5600-0261-11eb-8acb-0376021cc448.png)
The entire valdiation process can be monitored in the Terminal:  
![User Interface](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35747326/94601197-1e65bf80-0261-11eb-8ff9-0d71688d4530.png)

1. Drag and drop your configuration in the area indicated for this purpose
1. Click on validate

The validation report will be generated and saved at the default location or the path specified via the configuration file's `output` field.
The validation report can be displayed by a simple click on the `Display validation report` button, which will automatically open your default text editor with the content of the validation report. 
See [configuration section](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator#software-configuration) for more details regarding software configuration.

# Architecture

We use [clean architecture principles](https://medium.com/slalom-build/clean-architecture-with-java-11-f78bba431041) to implement this validator, which modularizes the project.

Some important modules:
* [Domain](domain) - Entity classes
* [Use cases](usecase) - Business logic 
* [Adapters](adapter) - Convertors (e.g., parsers and exporters)
* [application/cli-app](application/cli-app) - The main command-line application
* [application/spring-boot-app](application/spring-boot-app) - The spring boot implementation of the application
* [Client](client) - The web layer used to interact with the [spring-boot-app](application/spring-boot-app)
