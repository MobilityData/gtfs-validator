A GTFS Schedule (static) [General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)](https://gtfs.mobilitydata.org/spec/gtfs-schedule) feed validator

# Introduction
This is a command-line tool written in Java that performs the following steps:
1. Loads input GTFS zip file from a URL or disk
1. Checks file integrity, numeric type parsing and ranges as well as string format according to the [GTFS Schedule specification](https://gtfs.mobilitydata.org/spec/gtfs-schedule#h.hc443y62gb8c)
1. Performs GTFS [business rule validation](/RULES.md)

# Run the app via command line
### Setup
1. Install [Java 8 or higher](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
1. Download [gtfs-validator-v2.0.0_cli.jar](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator/releases/download/v2.0.0/gtfs-validator-v2.0.0_cli.jar)

### Run it
To validate a GTFS dataset on your computer:

`java -jar gtfs-validator-v2.0.0_cli.jar -i /myDirectory/gtfs.zip -o output -c ca` 

To download and validate a GTFS dataset from a URL:

`java -jar gtfs-validator-v2.0.0_cli.jar -u https://www.abc.com/gtfs.zip -o output -c ca`

where:
* `--input` or `-i`: the path to the GTFS file (e.g., `/myDirectory/gtfs.zip`)
* `--url` or `-u`: the fully qualified URL to the GTFS file (e.g., `https://www.abc.com/gtfs.zip`)
* `--output` or `-o`: the path where the validation report will be stored (e.g., `output`)
* *(Optional)* `--country_code` or `-c`: the country code of the feed as a valid [ISO two letter country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) (e.g., `ca`, `us`). It can be either lower or upper case (e.g. `FR` or `GP`). If `-c` is not provided or country code is unknown, phone numbers will be validated if they start by `+`.   
* *(Optional)* `--thread` or `-t`: the number of Java threads to use

More detailed instructions are on our ["Usage"](/docs/USAGE.md) page.

# Run the app using Docker
### Setup
1. Download and install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)
1. Pull the [latest Docker image for this project](https://github.com/orgs/MobilityData/packages/container/package/gtfs-validator). For example, `docker pull ghcr.io/mobilitydata/gtfs-validator:v2.0.0`.

### Run it

#### For Mac and Linux

To run the Docker image in a new container:

`docker run -v /myDirectory:/theContainerDirectory -it ghcr.io/mobilitydata/gtfs-validator:v2.0.0`

where:
* `-v /myDirectory:/theContainerDirectory`: syntax to share directories and data between the container and the host (your computer). With the above command, any files that you place in `/myDirectory` on the host will show up in `/theContainerDirectory` inside the container and vice versa.

***NOTE:*** On Windows, you must provide the local volume (e.g., `c:`) as well:

`... c:/myDirectory:/theContainerDirectory ...`

The validator can then be executed via bash commands. See the [preceeding instructions for command line usage](#run-the-app-via-command-line).

# Validation rules
* [Implemented rules](/RULES.md)
* [Possible future rules](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22new+rule%22)

Have a suggestion for a new rule? Open [an issue](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator/issues/new/choose). You can see the complete process for adding new rules on the ["Adding new rules"](/docs/NEW_RULES.md) page.
