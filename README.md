This README contains information for the latest version of the project, which is under active development.  You can find the latest version of the validator application on the [Releases page](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator/releases).

# Introduction
This is a cross-platform application written in Java that performs the following steps:
1. Loads input GTFS zip file from a URL or disk.
2. Checks file integrity, numeric type parsing and ranges.
3. Performs complete validation against the [GTFS Schedule standard](https://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/#h.hc443y62gb8c).
4. Provides an easy-to-use validation report in HTML format that can be opened in the browser and shared with other parties. See an [example of a validation report](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator/blob/master/docs/report.html). The report is also available in JSON format that can be used for parsing and running additional analyses.

# Using the web-based validator
The GTFS Web Validator can be accessed at [https://gtfs-validator.mobilitydata.org/](https://gtfs-validator.mobilitydata.org/).
The GTFS Web Validator accepts locally saved datasets in a zip format and datasets available via the Web in an URL format. 
Validation reports have a unique URL link that can be shared and are available 30 days after creation.

The GTFS Web Validator contains two main components: the GTFS Web Validator Client and the GTFS Validator Web Service. More information about these components can be found in [GTFS Web Validator Client](./web/client/README.md) and [GTFS Validator Web Service](./web/service/README.md).

Several users have reported issues with the validator when processing their GTFS feeds. These issues arise due to the configuration of their websites, which may not be set up to handle:

1. Requests that come with custom user agents.
2. Requests originating from non-browser sources.

To facilitate easier debugging and logging, we have made our user agent header explicit. The user agent string follows the format: "MobilityData GTFS-Validator/{validatorVersion} (Java {java version})". In cases where the `validatorVersion` is null, the `{validatorVersion}` segment in the user agent string will be left blank. The string "MobilityData GTFS-Validator/5.0.1 (Java 11.0.1)" serves as an example of the User Agent string.

# Using the Desktop app
### Setup
1. Navigate to the [Releases page](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator/releases) and download the latest `Gtfs Validator` installer for your operating system:
    * Windows => `.msi`
    * Mac OS => `.dmg`
    * Linux => `.deb`
2. Install application to your workstation.

### Run it
Once installed, run the application and you will see the following screen:

![Application-Windows](/docs/Application-Windows.png)

There are two primary options to set:

* `GTFS Input`: Use this to specify the GTFS feed to validate.  You can specify a URL, ZIP file, or a directory containing the individual `.txt` files of a feed.  You can paste the input location directly into the input field or use the `Choose Local File...` button to open a file-chooser dialog to select a file on your local system.
* `Output Directory`: This is the directory where the validation reports will be written.

With these two options set, click the "Validate" button to begin validation.

### Visualize the results

When validation is complete, the application will automatically open the HTML validation report in your local browser.  In addition, the application creates the following files in the output directory:
* `report.html`: the validation report in HTML format. It can be opened in a browser.
* `report.json`: the validation report in JSON format.
* `system_errors.json`: this file will be created every-time the validator is run. If no system errors were encountered, this file will be empty.

### Advanced Options
Before running validation, tap the `Advanced` button to configure other aspects of the application, including:
* Number of threads used to run the validator.
* The country code used for phone number validation.

# Using the command line
### Setup
1. Install [Java 11 or higher](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html). To check which version of Java is installed on your computer, type the following command in the terminal: `java --version`.
2. Navigate to the [Releases page](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator/releases) and download the latest `Gtfs Validator` CLI jar (not OS-specific). It is located in the **Assets** section of the release, and it looks like `gtfs-validator-vX.X.X_cli.jar`
3. Open the terminal on your computer
4. Navigate to the directory containing the jar file. You can do this by typing the following command in the terminal:`cd {directory path}`, where {directory path} is the absolute or relative path to the directory. You can then make sure you're in the right directory by typing `pwd` in the terminal (this stands for *present working directory*). You can also make sure the jar file is there by typing `ls` in the terminal (this stands for *list* and will display the list of files in this directory). More about commands to navigate file and directories [here](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal#File_.26_Directory_Commands).

### Run it
You can run this validator using a GTFS dataset on your computer, or from a URL.
- To validate a GTFS dataset on your computer, run the following command in the terminal, replacing the text in brackets:
  - `java -jar {name of the jar file} -i {path to the GTFS file} -o {name of the output directory that will be created}`
  - here is an example of what the command could look like:  `java -jar gtfs-validator-cli.jar -i /myDirectory/gtfs.zip -o output`

- To validate a GTFS dataset from a URL, run the following command in the terminal, replacing the text in brackets:
  - `java -jar {name of the jar file} -u {URL to the GTFS file} -o {name of the output directory that will be created}`
  - here is an example of what the command could look like: `java -jar gtfs-validator-cli.jar -u https://www.abc.com/gtfs.zip -o output`

More detailed instructions with all the parameters that exists are available on our ["Usage"](/docs/USAGE.md) page.

### Visualize the results
In the output directory, the reports will be created as described [here](#visualize-the-results).

# Using Docker
### Setup
1. Download and install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)
1. To obtain a validator Docker container image, you have two options:
    * Pull [a published Docker container image from GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/MobilityData/packages/container/package/gtfs-validator). For example, to pull the latest build of the `master` branch:

        ```bash
        docker pull ghcr.io/mobilitydata/gtfs-validator:latest
        ```

    * Build a Docker container image locally from any branch or working tree:

        ```bash
        docker build . -t ghcr.io/mobilitydata/gtfs-validator:latest
        ```

### Run it

#### For Mac and Linux

To verify you can run the Docker image in a new container and see the help text:

```bash
docker run --rm ghcr.io/mobilitydata/gtfs-validator:latest --help
```

In order to pass files in and out of the validator, you'll need to use a volume mount to share a directory between your host computer and the Docker container:

```bash
docker run --rm -v /myDirectory:/work ghcr.io/mobilitydata/gtfs-validator:latest -i /work/gtfs.zip -o /work/output
```

where:
* `-v /myDirectory:/work`: syntax to share directories and data between the container and the host (your computer). With the above command, any files that you place in `/myDirectory` on the host will show up in `/work` inside the container and vice versa.

***NOTE:*** On Windows, you must provide the local volume (e.g., `c:`) as well:

`... c:/myDirectory:/work ...`

The validator can then be executed via bash commands. See the [preceeding instructions for command line usage](#run-the-app-via-command-line).

### Visualize the results
In the output directory, the reports will be created as described [here](#visualize-the-results).

Instructions to build the project from the command-line using [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) are available in our [Build documentation](/docs/BUILD.md).

# Architecture
The architecture of the `gtfs-validator` is described on our [Architecture page](/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md). 

# Acceptance tests
In order to avoid sudden changes in the validation output that might declare previously valid datasets invalid, all code changes in pull requests are tested against GTFS datasets in the [MobilityDatabase](http://old.mobilitydatabase.org/wiki/Main_Page). The acceptance test process is described in [ACCEPTANCE_TESTS.md](docs/ACCEPTANCE_TESTS.md).
