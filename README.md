A GTFS Schedule (static) [General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)](https://gtfs.mobilitydata.org/spec/gtfs-schedule) feed validator

# Introduction

This command-line tool written in Java that performs the following steps:
1. Loads input GTFS zip file from a URL or disk
1. Checks file integrity, numeric type parsing and ranges as well as string format according to the [GTFS Schedule specification](https://gtfs.mobilitydata.org/spec/gtfs-schedule#h.hc443y62gb8c)
1. Performs GTFS [business rule validation](/RULES.md)

# Run the app

### Setup
1. Install [Java 8 or higher](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
1. Download [gtfs-validator-v2.0.0_cli.jar](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator/releases/download/v2.0.0/gtfs-validator-v2.0.0_cli.jar)

### Run it

To validate a GTFS dataset on your computer:

`java -jar gtfs-validator-v2.0.0_cli.jar -i /myDirectory/gtfs.zip -o output -f ca-myFeedName` 

To download and validate a GTFS dataset from a URL:

`java -jar gtfs-validator-v2.0.0_cli.jar -u https://www.abc.com/gtfs.zip -o output -f ca-myFeedName`

where:
* `--input` or `-i`: the path to the GTFS file (e.g., `/myDirectory/gtfs.zip`)
* `--url` or `-u`: the fully qualified URL to the GTFS file (e.g., `https://www.abc.com/gtfs.zip`)
* `--output` or `-o`: the path where the validation report will be stored (e.g., `output`)
* `--feed_name` or `-f`: the name of the feed as a valid [ISO two letter country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2), followed by `-`, followed by a user-defined name for the feed. (e.g., `ca-myFeedName`, `us-myFeedName`)
* *(Optional)* `--thread` or `-t`: the number of Java threads to use

More detailed instructions are on our ["Usage"](/docs/USAGE.md) page.
