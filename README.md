A GTFS Schedule (static) [General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)](https://gtfs.mobilitydata.org/spec/gtfs-schedule) feed validator

# Introduction

This command-line tool written in Java that performs the following steps:
1. Loads input GTFS zip file from a URL or disk
1. Checks files integrity, numeric type parsing and ranges as well as string format according to the [GTFS Schedule specification](https://gtfs.mobilitydata.org/spec/gtfs-schedule#h.hc443y62gb8c)
1. Performs basic GTFS business rule validation
1. Performs advanced GTFS business rule validation *(work-in-progress)*

# Usage

## via GitHub Actions - run the validator on any gtfs archive available on a public url

## TLDR;
Fork this repository, open a PR on master within it, edit the file `.github/workflows/end_to_end.yml` following instructions on lines 5, 43-45 and **push** on your PR branch. Name your branch from the agency/authority/publisher of the feed you are testing.
You should now see the workflow `End to end / run-on-data` start automatically in your PR checks, running the validator on the dataset you just added. The validation report is collected as a run artifact in the Actions tab of your fork repository on GitHub.

If the workflow run crashes or something doesn't look right in the validation report json file, **please see the [Contribute](#Contribute) section, we may be able to help!**

## longer version - step by step through GitHub web UI (screenshots coming soon)
1. go to https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator

1. **click** on the `fork` button on the *top right corner*
1. **wait** for the fork creation, you should now see your fork (https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gtfs-validator)
1. **navigate** to `.github/workflows/end_to_end.yml`
1. **click** the *crayon* icon to enter edit mode
1. on line 5, **replace** `transport-agency-name` by something significant like `societe-de-transport-de-montreal` if you were adding a dataset from *STM*
1. **keep it around** as you'll need it in *step 15.*
1. **uncomment** line 43 by removing the `#` character
1. on line 43, **replace** `ACRONYM` by some acronym for the Agency/publisher, in our example that would be `STM`
1. **uncomment** line 44 by removing the `#` character
1. on line 44, **replace** `[[[ACRONYM]]]` in `[[[ACRONYM]]].zip` by what you put down in step 12 - **NO SPACES OR SPECIAL CHARACTERS -- keep the .zip extension intact**
1. on line 44, **replace** `DATASET_PUBLIC_URL` by a *public url* pointing to a [GTFS Schedule](https://gtfs.mobilitydata.org/spec/gtfs-schedule) zip archive
1. **clic** on the *green* `Start commit` button on the right of the page
1. **select the option ` Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request.`**
1. **replace** the proposed default branch name by what you got from *step 7.* Note that the branch name must exactly match the line 5 text (e.g., `societe-de-transport-de-montreal`).
1. **click** the *green* `Propose changes` button
1. on the next screen, **click** `Create pull request`

You should now see the workflow `End to end / run-on-data` start automatically in your PR checks, running the validator on the dataset you just added. The validation report is collected as a run artifact in the Actions tab of your fork repository on GitHub.

If the workflow run crashes or something doesn't look right in the validation report json file, **please see the [Contribute](#Contribute) section, we may be able to help!**


## via Docker image

# Prerequisites

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
1. Retrieve an image from our [package page](https://github.com/orgs/MobilityData/packages/container/package/gtfs-validator).
For snapshot versions of the master branch
``` 
docker pull ghcr.io/mobilitydata/gtfs-validator:master
```
- we also provide images of our tagged versions starting with `v1.3.0`

3. Run the image either in the Docker Dashboard UI (dont forget to bind port 8090) or via this command
``` 
docker run -p 8090:8090 ghcr.io/mobilitydata/gtfs-validator:[[[REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_TAG]]]
```

By default, you will then have access to the web version of the validator at http://localhost:8090/
See [Web app usage](#web-app-usage)

If you want to use the cli version within Docker, you must first stop the web app with the following command
``` 
TODO: Could not figure out command.
```

**Note:** if you don't do it, the cli app will compete for resources within the container

After attaching a terminal to the running container, navigate to the cli jar folder
``` 
cd /usr/gtfs-validator/cli-app
```
you can then follow the instructions of the next sections

Note: As a convenience, a `shell script` file is provided in the same directory. It is [copied in the Docker image](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator/blob/253bc9ccb019ca98bad1f429d91bc4fe03b8020d/Dockerfile#L3) from [end_to_end.sh](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator/blob/master/application/cli-app/scripts/end_to_end.sh)
It can be used to run the validator in an automated way *via Java on your local computer* as described in the next section. Only **community based support** is provided for local runs of the validator.

## via Java on your local computer

# Prerequisites

1. Install [Java 11 or higher](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
1. Download the latest gtfs-validator JAR (cli or web) file from our [Releases page](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator/releases) or snapshot artifact from [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator/actions?query=branch%3Amaster) or [Circle-CI Pipelines](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/MobilityData/gtfs-validator?branch=master)

## cli-app usage

### Validate a locally stored GTFS dataset

Sample usage:

``` 
java -jar gtfs-validator-v1.3.0_cli.jar -i relative/path/to/zipped_dataset -o relative/output/path -e relative/extraction/path -x enumeration_of_files_to_exclude_from_validation_process
```

...which will:
 1. Search for a zipped GTFS dataset located at `relative/path/to/zipped_dataset`
 1. Extract the zip content to a directory located at `relative/extraction/path`
 1. Validate the GTFS data and output the results to the directory located at `relative/output/path`. Validation results are exported to JSON by default. The validation process will not be executed on the enumeration of files provided via option `-x` and the files that rely on them.
 1. Validate the GTFS data and output the results to the directory named `output_folder`. This folder will contain a single `.json` file with information related to the validation process.
 1. The generated `.json` file will be beautified if option `-b` or `--beautify`  has been provided and set to `true`. Note that if this argument is not specified, the validator will by default generate a beautified version of the validation report. 

Note:
 - *export validation report as `.json` file*: After validating [MBTA's GTFS archive](https://cdn.mbta.com/MBTA_GTFS.zip) on 2020-10-20 at 09:07:48 (America/Montreal timezone), the validation report will be named as follows `MBTA__2020-10-20_09/07/48.442365.json`
 - *export validation report as `.pb` file*: after validating [MBTA's GTFS archive](https://cdn.mbta.com/MBTA_GTFS.zip) on 2020-10-20 at 09:07:48 (America/Montreal timezone), the validation reports will be named as follows 
   - `MBTA__2020-10-20_09/07/48.442365-1.pb` 
   - `MBTA__2020-10-20_09/07/48.442365-2.pb` 
   - ...
   - `MBTA__2020-10-20_09/07/48.442365-n.pb` 

**Those names come from concatenating the information found in `feed_info.feed_publisher_name` and the local time of execution separated with `__`
then replacing whitespace character by `_`**

In the case where GTFS file`feed_info.txt`  is not provided, the validation report name would be limited to: `__2020-10-20_09/07/48.442365.json` or `__2020-10-20_09/07/48.442365-1.pb`    

#### Example: Validate GTFS dataset while specifying extraction, input, and output directories

``` 
java -jar gtfs-validator-v1.3.0_cli.jar -i gtfs-dataset.zip -o output_folder -e extraction_folder
```

In order, this command line will:
 1. Search for a zipped GTFS dataset name `gtfs-dataset.zip` located in the working directory
 1. Extract its content to a directory named `extraction_folder`
 1. Validate the GTFS data and output the results to the directory named `output_folder`. This folder will contain a single `.json` file with information related to the validation process.
 1. The generated `.json` file will be beautified if option `-b` or `--beautify`  has been provided and set to `true`. Note that if this argument is not specified, the validator will by default generate a beautified version of the validation report. 
 


#### Example: Validate a subset of a GTFS dataset.

``` 
java -jar gtfs-validator-v1.3.0_cli.jar -i gtfs-dataset.zip  -x fare_attributes.txt,attributions.txt
```

In order, this command line will:
 1. Search for a zipped GTFS dataset name `gtfs-dataset.zip` located in the working directory
 1. Create a directory named `input` 
 1. Extract the content of `gtfs-dataset.zip` to the directory created at step 2
 1. Create a directory names `output`
 1. Exclude files `fare_attributes.txt` and `attributions.txt` from the validation process. But also the files that rely on them: `translations.txt` and `fare_rules.txt`
 1. Validate the GTFS data and output the results to the directory created at step 4. This folder will contain a single `.json` file with information related to the validation process.

### Validate a GTFS dataset stored on a remote server

Sample usage:

``` 
java -jar gtfs-validator-v1.3.0_cli.jar -u url/to/dataset -o relative/output/path -e relative/extraction/path -i input.zip
```

...which will:
 1. Download the GTFS feed at the URL `url/to/dataset` and name it `input.zip`  
 1. Extract the `input.zip` content to the directory located at `relative/extraction/path`
 1. Validate the GTFS data and output the results to the directory located at `relative/output/path`. Validation results are exported to JSON by default.

#### Example: Validate a GTFS dataset and export the validation result as proto files

``` 
java -jar gtfs-validator-v1.3.0_cli.jar -u url/to/dataset -o output_folder -e extraction_folder -i local-dataset.zip -p
```

In order, this command line will:
 1. Download the GTFS feed at the URL `url/to/dataset` and name it `local-dataset.zip`
 1. Extract the `local-dataset.zip` content to the directory `extraction_folder`
 1. Validate the GTFS data and output the results to the directory `output_folder`. As option `-p` is provided, results will be exported as `.pb` files

#### Example: Validate a GTFS dataset without specifying command arguments or providing configuration file

``` 
java -jar gtfs-validator-v1.3.0_cli.jar
```

In order, this command line will:
 1. Search for a zipped folder in the working directory
 1. Extract by default the content of the zipped GTFS dataset to directory `gtfs-validator/input/`  
 1. Validate the GTFS data and output the results to directory `gtfs-validator/output`. Validation results will be exported to JSON by default.


For a list of all available commands, use `--help`:

``` 
java -jar gtfs-validator-v1.3.0_cli.jar --help
```

### Software configuration

Execution parameters are configurable through command-line or via a configuration file `execution-parameters.json`. 
By default, if no command-line is provided the validation process will look for execution parameters in user configurable configuration file `execution-parameters.json`.
In the case said file could not be found or is incomplete, default values will be used.

One should note that if both command-line options and configuration file are provided, the configuration file takes precedence over the command option.

Sample usage:

The two following sample usages are equivalent, provided that `execution-parameters.json` file is located in the working directory:

``` 
java -jar gtfs-validator-v1.3.0_cli.jar -e relative/extraction/path -o relative/output/path -i relative/path/to/zipped_dataset -x agency.txt,routes.txt
```
```
{
  "extract": "relative/extraction/path",
  "output": "relative/output/path",
  "input": "relative/path/to/zipped_dataset",
  "exclude": "agency.txt,routes.txt"
}
```

Note that you'll need to change the above JAR file name to whatever [release version](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator/releases) you download.

## web-app usage

A second implementation of `gtfs-validator` uses [`SpringBoot`](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) framework and a user interface (based on [`React`](https://reactjs.org/)).

### Run the application via Java on your local computer

```
java -jar gtfs-validator-v1.3.0_web.war 
```

Which will:
1. Launch server side of application on port `8090`
1. Launch client side of the application on port `8090`

Open your favorite browser and go to `http://localhost:8090` the user interface of the application should be displayed as follows:
![User Interface](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35747326/94601198-1efe5600-0261-11eb-8acb-0376021cc448.png)
The entire valdiation process can be monitored in the Terminal:  
![User Interface](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35747326/94601197-1e65bf80-0261-11eb-8ff9-0d71688d4530.png)

1. Drag and drop your configuration in the area indicated for this purpose
1. Click on validate

The validation report will be generated and saved at the default location or the path specified via the configuration file's `output` field.
The validation report can be displayed by a simple click on the `Display validation report` button, which will automatically open your default text editor with the content of the validation report. 
See [configuration section](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator#software-configuration) for more details regarding software configuration.

#### Run the web-app in development mode
     
```
$ yarn start
```

This command runs the app in the development mode.
Note that this command should be ran in [/application/web-app/react-client/](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator/tree/master/application/web-app/react-client)
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The development page will reload if you edit the React project.

You will also be able to see any lint errors in the console. 

You can refer to [this documentation](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator/blob/master/application/web-app/react-client/README.md) for more information regarding the React implementation of the web-app.

# Architecture

We use [clean architecture principles](https://medium.com/slalom-build/clean-architecture-with-java-11-f78bba431041) to implement this validator, which modularizes the project.

Some important modules:
* [domain](domain/src/main/java/org/mobilitydata/gtfsvalidator/domain) - Entity classes
* [use cases](usecase/src/main/java/org/mobilitydata/gtfsvalidator/usecase) - Business logic 
* [adapter](adapter) - Convertors (e.g., parsers and exporters)
* [application/cli-app](application/cli-app) - The main command-line application
* [application/web-app/react-client](application/web-app/react-client) - The local web ui as a React project  
* [application/web-app/spring-server](application/web-app/spring-server) - The implementation of the application that relies on SpringBoot framework

# Run Tests locally

## Unitary

To run tests:

## End to end

### via `run-on-data` GitHub workflow job

There is a way to locally execute the [`run-on-data` job of the end_to_end GitHub workflow](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator/blob/24d58c8ee76af00aa3ab413b218b4a8e2cfafc4b/.github/workflows/end_to_end.yml#L9)

You need Docker to be installed

Install [act](https://github.com/nektos/act)
```
brew install act
```

In the repo root folder
```
act -j run-on-data
```

Note: we run into a [know issue](nektos/act#329) of `act` when trying to collect artifacts
```
[End to end/run-on-data]   ❗  ::error::Unable to get ACTIONS_RUNTIME_TOKEN env variable
```

.zip dataset files and .json validation report files still are available **within the Docker image (`docker exec -it`) ** for manual collection
