# Discovery of features in feeds

The validator will produce the [list of features](https://gtfs.org/getting_started/features/overview/) that it finds in the processed feed according to this table:

| Feature Group              | Feature                   | How is the presence of a feature determined (minimum requirements)  |   Documentation Link                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

# Feature migration

Overview of the list of features for each release. Only the releases that affect the list of features are included in this table: if a release number isn't in this table, it means the features were not affected.  
If a feature is dropped from one older release to a newer release; it means it has been replaced by one or more new features.
