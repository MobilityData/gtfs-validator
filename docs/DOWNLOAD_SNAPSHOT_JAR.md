# Instructions to download the latest snapshot version of the validator

The following workflows produce artifacts that are stored for a period of 90 days:

More particularly, [`test_pack_doc.yml`](../.github/workflows/test_pack_doc.yml) is responsible to automatically test, package and document the project.
This workflow is triggered on each commit of each branch. 

As a result, the latest snapshot version of the validator can be found under the list of artifacts generated when this workflow is executed on the `master` branch.
The application jar is named as "Application - cli executable.jar --v-master-sha-*-SNAPSHOT".

See the following instructions to download the artifact:

1. Access the actions listing on the project's main page
2. Select `Test Package Document` in the `Workflows` column
3. Select `master` branch

These three aforementioned steps can be skipped if you directly go to the following url: [Test Package Document workflow executions on master branch](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator/actions/workflows/test_pack_doc.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)

4. Select the first item in the list that has a green check: it is the latest iteration of the workflow that was run on the master branch
5. Click on the artifact's name that is needed to start download
