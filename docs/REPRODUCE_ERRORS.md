You should now see the workflow `End to end / run-on-data` start automatically in your PR checks, running the validator on the dataset you just added. The validation report is collected as a run artifact in the Actions tab of your fork repository on GitHub.

ðŸŽ‰ Thank you very very much! The end to end workflow will run on the newly created PR in our repository and automatically collect all relevant information. We take care of everything from then and will follow up directly in the PR.

While we welcome all contributions, our [members and sponsors](https://mobilitydata.org/members/) see their PRs and issues prioritized.
