```
is:pr is:closed merged:>2020-07-28 base:master sort:updated-desc 
```
2. When the CI is done, drag and drop the artifacts in the pre release assets section. You'll need to manually rename some of the assets for now (see below).

3. Rename the artefacts so the names to stay consistent with previous releases. **It is important that the installers artefacts always have exactly the same name**, in order to have stable URL's that point to the latest installer. The installers should be named as follow:
- Installer.windows.zip
- Installer.ubuntu.zip
- Installer.macos.zip

4. Once everything is ready, simply uncheck the `pre release` box and publish again ‚úÖ
