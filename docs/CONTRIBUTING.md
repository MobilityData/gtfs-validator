## How to run tests locally
This project includes unit and end-to-end tests in order to:
1. Verify the implementation behaves as expected in tests as well as on real data
1. Make sure any new implementation does not involuntarily break existing code

Run the following command at the root of the project to run Java tests:
```
$ ./gradlew test
```
